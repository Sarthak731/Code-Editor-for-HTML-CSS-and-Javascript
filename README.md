# Code-Editor-for-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript
This project involves creating a basic in-browser code editor using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The editor allows users to write, edit, and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in the browser, making it an educational tool for learning and experimenting with web development.

Key Features:

Multiple Code Panels: The editor is divided into three distinct panels for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code input. Each panel allows users to write code specific to these technologies in a clean, well-organized environment.

Live Preview: One of the most interactive features is the live preview panel, where users can instantly see the result of their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as they type. Changes made in any of the code panels immediately reflect in the output window without needing to refresh the page.

Syntax Highlighting: Using basic JavaScript libraries or custom CSS, the code input areas offer syntax highlighting, enhancing the readability and understanding of the code being written.

Technical Stack:

HTML: Provides the structure of the editor, including the code input areas, preview window, and buttons for functionality like clearing code or changing themes.

CSS: Styles the interface, making it visually appealing with a clean, user-friendly design. CSS is also used to implement the light and dark theme functionality.

JavaScript: Handles the core functionality of the editor, including capturing user input, dynamically updating the preview panel, and providing syntax highlighting. JavaScript also manages layout adjustments like resizable panels.

Project Objectives:

To create a functional code editor that allows users to write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time.

To practice integrating live code evaluation with JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

To offer a tool for learning and experimenting with web development by building an interactive in-browser coding environment.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to explore how in-browser development tools work, and it provides hands-on experience with core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
